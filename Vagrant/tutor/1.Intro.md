- Orchestrates "provisioning"
	- On demand setup
- Shared Folders

### Two Architecture

 - Kitchen Sink (All in one)
	 - Host runs VMs only
	 - IDE/Editor in VM
	 - GUI in VM
	 - All work in VM
	 - Deploy in VM
 - Light Server
	 - Host has IDE/Editor
	 - Host runs VM
	 - Shared folder
	 - VM for local deploy
	 - No GUI for VM

### Core Concept

 - Boxes
	 - Container for OS
	 - Versioned
	 - User-level
		- ~/.vagrant.d/boxes
	- One provider/box
	
 - Provisioning
	 - Build upon base Box
